    <p> Hello everybody, I am Oluwasegun, I am 21 years old.  I am from Lagos, Nigeria, I am from a family of 5, which includes my dad, mom and 2 siblings. My time zone is the Western African Time (WAT). </p>
    <p> My hobbies are playing and watching soccer, listening to music, and reading. My dad introduced me to this church 3 years ago, and I'm happy to be a member of the church. </p>
    <p> I chose this course because I have a passion for computers, and I'm fascinated with the concept behind computers. </p>
